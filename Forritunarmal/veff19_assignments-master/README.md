# Lab and project assignments
## T-213-VEFF:Web Programming I - Reykjavik University, Spring 2019 
## Instructor: Grischa Liebel, grischal@ru.is

This repository includes assignments for Web Programming I. Assignments (both lab and project assignments) will be incrementally added throughout the course duration.

## Create your working copy
To create your own version of the repository, you create a **fork** of the repository (in the top right corner of the repository page on Gitlab, you click "Fork"). This fork is then your very own copy of the repo, which you can clone and modify. If you commit any changes that are part of the solution, make sure to **make the repository private** - otherwise all others can see it, which means you are **plagiarising**.

## Update your fork with changes
Whenever we publish a new assignment, you will have to get the updates into your own fork. You do this in git using fetch. See the following tutorial on how to do that: [https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). Make sure to commit all unsaved changes before you do this!
